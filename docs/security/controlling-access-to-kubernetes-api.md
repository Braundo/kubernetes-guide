## Transport Security
- The Kubernetes API server listens on port 6443 by default, protected by TLS.
- In production, it usually serves on port 443.
- The API server presents a certificate, which can be signed by a private or public CA.
- If using a private CA, the client needs to have a copy of the CA certificate.


## Authentication
- Once TLS is established, the HTTP request moves to the Authentication step.
- The API server can run one or more Authenticator modules.
- Authenticators can include client certificates, passwords, plain tokens, bootstrap tokens, and JSON Web Tokens (for service accounts).
- If authentication fails, the request is rejected with HTTP status code 401.


## Authorization
- After authentication, the request must be authorized.
- Authorization is based on policies that specify what actions a user can perform.
- For example, a user "Bob" might have read-only access to "pods" in the "projectCaribou" namespace.
- Multiple authorization modules like ABAC, RBAC, and Webhook can be used.


## Admission Control
- Admission Control modules can modify or reject requests.
- They act on requests that create, modify, delete, or connect to an object but not on read-only requests.
- If any admission controller rejects the request, it is immediately denied.
- Admission controllers can also set complex defaults for fields.


## Auditing
- Kubernetes auditing provides a set of records documenting actions in a cluster.
- It audits activities generated by users, applications using the API, and the control plane.
