## X.509 Client Certificate Authentication
- Used for system components like Kubelet to API Server.
- Not suitable for user authentication due to non-revocable certificates and other limitations.


## Static Token File
- Credentials are stored in clear text on control plane node disks.
- Not recommended for production due to security risks and lack of lockout mechanisms.


## Bootstrap Tokens
- Used for joining nodes to clusters.
- Not suitable for user authentication due to hard-coded group memberships and lack of lockout mechanisms.


## ServiceAccount Secret Tokens
- Used for workloads in the cluster to authenticate to the API server.
- Being replaced with TokenRequest API tokens.
Unsuitable for user authentication for various reasons, including lack of expiry.


## TokenRequest API Tokens
- Useful for short-lived service authentication.
- Not recommended for user authentication due to lack of revocation methods.


## OpenID Connect (OIDC) Token Authentication
- Allows integration with external identity providers.
- Requires careful setup and short token lifespan for security.


## Webhook Token Authentication
- Allows an external service to make authentication decisions via a webhook.
- Suitability depends on the software used for the authentication service.


## Authenticating Proxy
