# Troubleshooting Kubernetes

Troubleshooting is a crucial skill for managing Kubernetes clusters. This section provides strategies and tools for diagnosing and resolving common issues.

## Common Issues and Solutions

| Issue                       | Description                                                                 | Solution                                                                                       |
|-----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **CrashLoopBackOff**        | Pod repeatedly crashing.                                                    | Check logs with `kubectl logs <pod-name>`.                                                    |
| **ImagePullBackOff**        | Kubernetes cannot pull the container image.                                 | Verify the image name and credentials.                                                         |
| **Node Not Ready**          | Node is not functioning correctly.                                          | Check node status with `kubectl get nodes` and review the kubelet logs.                        |
| **Disk Pressure**           | Node runs low on disk space.                                                | Free up space or add more storage.                                                             |
| **Service Not Accessible**  | Service configuration or endpoints issue.                                   | Check service configuration with `kubectl get svc` and `kubectl describe svc <service-name>`. |
| **DNS Resolution Failures** | DNS pod status or configuration issue.                                      | Verify DNS pod status and configuration with `kubectl get pods -n kube-system`.               |
| **Pod Eviction**            | Pods are evicted due to resource constraints.                               | Check node resource usage and adjust limits or requests.                                       |
| **High CPU Usage**          | Pods or nodes experiencing high CPU usage.                                  | Analyze CPU usage with `kubectl top` and optimize application resource requests.               |
| **Network Latency**         | High latency in network communication between Pods.                         | Check network policies and configurations, and ensure sufficient bandwidth.                    |

## Tools for Troubleshooting

| Command      | Description                                      | Example Usage                                   |
|--------------|--------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| **`describe`** | Provides detailed information about resources.   | `kubectl describe pod <pod-name>`               |
| **`logs`**     | Retrieves logs from containers.                  | `kubectl logs <pod-name>`                       |
| **`exec`**     | Executes commands in a container.                | `kubectl exec -it <pod-name> -- /bin/sh`        |

<h3>Monitoring and Logging</h3>

- **Prometheus:** Collects metrics and provides alerts. It's highly customizable and integrates well with Kubernetes. [Learn more](https://prometheus.io/)
- **Grafana:** Visualizes metrics collected by Prometheus and other sources. It offers a rich set of dashboards and visualization tools. [Learn more](https://grafana.com/)
- **Elasticsearch, Fluentd, Kibana (EFK) Stack:** Centralizes logging and provides search capabilities. Elasticsearch stores logs, Fluentd collects and forwards them, and Kibana visualizes the data. [Learn more about Elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co/elasticsearch/), [Fluentd](https://www.fluentd.org/), [Kibana](https://www.elastic.co/kibana/)

## Best Practices

- **Regular Monitoring:** Continuously monitor cluster health and performance.
- **Automated Alerts:** Set up alerts for critical issues to ensure timely response.
- **Documentation:** Keep detailed records of issues and solutions for future reference.
