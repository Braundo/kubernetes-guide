<h1>Troubleshooting Kubernetes</h1>

Troubleshooting is a crucial skill for managing Kubernetes clusters. This section provides strategies and tools for diagnosing and resolving common issues.

<h2>Common Issues and Solutions</h2>

| Issue                       | Description                                                                 | Solution                                                                                       |
|-----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| <strong>CrashLoopBackOff</strong>        | Pod repeatedly crashing.                                                    | Check logs with <code>kubectl logs &lt;pod-name&gt;</code>.                                                    |
| <strong>ImagePullBackOff</strong>        | Kubernetes cannot pull the container image.                                 | Verify the image name and credentials.                                                         |
| <strong>Node Not Ready</strong>          | Node is not functioning correctly.                                          | Check node status with <code>kubectl get nodes</code> and review the kubelet logs.                        |
| <strong>Disk Pressure</strong>           | Node runs low on disk space.                                                | Free up space or add more storage.                                                             |
| <strong>Service Not Accessible</strong>  | Service configuration or endpoints issue.                                   | Check service configuration with <code>kubectl get svc</code> and <code>kubectl describe svc &lt;service-name&gt;</code>. |
| <strong>DNS Resolution Failures</strong> | DNS pod status or configuration issue.                                      | Verify DNS pod status and configuration with <code>kubectl get pods -n kube-system</code>.               |
| <strong>Pod Eviction</strong>            | Pods are evicted due to resource constraints.                               | Check node resource usage and adjust limits or requests.                                       |
| <strong>High CPU Usage</strong>          | Pods or nodes experiencing high CPU usage.                                  | Analyze CPU usage with <code>kubectl top</code> and optimize application resource requests.               |
| <strong>Network Latency</strong>         | High latency in network communication between Pods.                         | Check network policies and configurations, and ensure sufficient bandwidth.                    |

<h2>Tools for Troubleshooting</h2>

| Command      | Description                                      | Example Usage                                   |
|--------------|--------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| <strong>describe</strong> | Provides detailed information about resources.   | <code>kubectl describe pod &lt;pod-name&gt;</code>               |
| <strong>logs</strong>     | Retrieves logs from containers.                  | <code>kubectl logs &lt;pod-name&gt;</code>                       |
| <strong>exec</strong>     | Executes commands in a container.                | <code>kubectl exec -it &lt;pod-name&gt; -- /bin/sh</code>        |

<h3>Monitoring and Logging</h3>

- **Prometheus:** Collects metrics and provides alerts. It's highly customizable and integrates well with Kubernetes. [Learn more](https://prometheus.io/)

- **Grafana:** Visualizes metrics collected by Prometheus and other sources. It offers a rich set of dashboards and visualization tools. [Learn more](https://grafana.com/)

- **Elasticsearch, Fluentd, Kibana (EFK) Stack:** Centralizes logging and provides search capabilities. Elasticsearch stores logs, Fluentd collects and forwards them, and Kibana visualizes the data. [Learn more about Elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co/elasticsearch/), [Fluentd](https://www.fluentd.org/), [Kibana](https://www.elastic.co/kibana/)

<h2>Best Practices</h2>

- <strong>Regular Monitoring:</strong> Continuously monitor cluster health and performance.

- <strong>Automated Alerts:</strong> Set up alerts for critical issues to ensure timely response.

- <strong>Documentation:</strong> Keep detailed records of issues and solutions for future reference.
