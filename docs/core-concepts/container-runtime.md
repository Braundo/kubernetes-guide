## History

Initially, Docker was the predominant container runtime, integral to Kubernetes' orchestration capabilities. To accommodate a broader range of container technologies, Kubernetes later introduced the Container Runtime Interface (CRI), facilitating integration with any runtime conforming to the Open Container Initiative (OCI) standards, notably the `imagespec` for building images and the `runtimespec` for developing runtimes.
<br>

Despite its popularity, Docker did not initially support CRI, as it predated the standard. To bridge this gap, Docker developed the Docker Shimâ€”a provisional solution for integrating Docker with Kubernetes without full CRI compliance. Docker's ecosystem also includes `containerd`, an OCI-compliant runtime capable of operating independently of Docker.
<br>

Starting with Kubernetes version 1.24, support for Docker Shim was phased out in favor of `containerd`, which became the default runtime. Nonetheless, Docker images remain compatible with Kubernetes due to their adherence to the `imagespec` OCI standard, ensuring seamless operation with `containerd`.
<br>

When Kubernetes introduced the [Container Runtime Interface](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/architecture/cri/) (CRI) it allowed any runtime to be used as long as they adhered to the [Open Container Initiative](https://opencontainers.org/) (OCI). There are two main specs to be aware of: 
- **`imagespec`** - how an image should be built
- **`runtimespec`** - how a container runtime should be developed

## containerd

`containerd` has achieved graduated status within the CNCF, highlighting its maturity and stability as a container runtime. It can be installed independently of Docker, providing a streamlined, Docker-free deployment option. While `containerd` includes a command-line tool called `ctr`, this tool is primarily intended for debugging purposes and may not be as user-friendly for general usage.
