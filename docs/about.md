My name is Aaron Braundmeier and I've been working in the tech industry for over a decade at companies such as Mastercard, VMware, and Broadcom (new adventure coming soon). I've long been a Kubernetes fan and had the privilege of working hands-on in that space during my time within the [Tanzu](https://tanzu.vmware.com/platform) business unit at VMware.

I'm a Certified Kubernetes Administrator (CKA) and am always interesting in learning and being hands-on with all things Kubernetes.

If you're interested in connecting, I can be reached in the following ways:
