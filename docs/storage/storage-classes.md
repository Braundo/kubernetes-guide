## Introduction
- StorageClass in Kubernetes allows administrators to define different "classes" of storage. These classes can represent various quality-of-service levels, backup policies, or any arbitrary policies set by the administrators. Kubernetes doesn't enforce what these classes should represent.


## The StorageClass Resource
- A StorageClass contains fields like provisioner, parameters, and reclaimPolicy. These are used when dynamically provisioning a
- PersistentVolume (PV) that belongs to the class. The name of the StorageClass is significant and is used by users to request a specific class. Administrators can also set a default StorageClass for PVCs that don't specify any class.


## Default StorageClass
- If a PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC) doesn't specify a storageClassName, the cluster's default StorageClass is used. Only one default StorageClass can exist in a cluster.


## Provisioner
- Specifies what volume plugin is used for provisioning PVs. Both internal and external provisioners can be used. For example, NFS doesn't have an internal provisioner but can use an external one.


## Reclaim Policy
- Specifies what happens to a dynamically created PV when it is released. The options are `Delete` or `Retain`.


## Allow Volume Expansion
- Indicates whether a PV can be expanded. This is controlled by the allowVolumeExpansion field in the StorageClass.


## Mount Options
- Specifies mount options for dynamically created PVs. If an invalid mount option is given, the PV mount will fail.


## Volume Binding Mode
- Controls when volume binding and provisioning occur. The default is `Immediate` mode, but `WaitForFirstConsumer` mode can be used for topology-constrained storage backends.


## Allowed Topologies
- Used to restrict the topology of provisioned volumes to specific zones.


## Parameters
- Describes additional provisioning parameters that are specific to the provisioner. For example, AWS EBS-specific parameters like `type`, `iopsPerGB`, etc.


## AWS EBS
- Provides an example of how to define a StorageClass for AWS EBS, including various parameters like `type`, `iopsPerGB`, and `fsType`.


## GCE PD
- Similar to AWS but for Google Cloud's Persistent Disk. Includes parameters like `type`, `fstype`, and `replication-type`.


## NFS
- Explains that Kubernetes doesn't have an internal NFS provisioner and provides examples of how to use an external NFS provisioner.


## vSphere
- Discusses two types of provisioners for vSphere and provides examples of how to define a StorageClass for vSphere.


## Ceph RBD
- Notes that the internal provisioner for Ceph RBD is deprecated and provides an example of a StorageClass for Ceph.
- Azure Disk: Provides an example of a StorageClass for Azure Disk but the content is truncated.
