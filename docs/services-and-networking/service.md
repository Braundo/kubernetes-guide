What is a Service?
A Kubernetes Service is an abstraction layer that defines a logical set of Pods and enables external traffic exposure, load balancing, and service discovery.


## Types of Services
1. **ClusterIP**:
    - Default type.
    - Exposes the service on an internal IP in the cluster.
    - Accessible only within the cluster.

2. **NodePort**:
    - Exposes the service on a static port on each Nodeâ€™s IP.
    - External entities can access it by `:`.

3. **LoadBalancer**:
    - Provisions an external load balancer and assigns a fixed, external IP to the service.
    - Typically used in cloud environments.

4. **ExternalName**:
    - Maps the service to the contents of the externalName field (e.g., `foo.bar.example.com`).


## Service Discovery
- Services are discoverable through environment variables or DNS.
- The kube-dns component handles DNS-based service discovery.


## Selector and Labels
- Services route traffic to Pods based on label selectors.


## Ports
- You can specify `port` (port exposed by the service), `targetPort` (port on the Pod), and `nodePort` (port on the node).


## Endpoints
- Services have associated Endpoints that contain the IP addresses of the Pods the traffic should be routed to.


## Session Affinity
- Services support `None` and `ClientIP` session affinity to maintain session state.


## Service Account
- You can associate a service account to control the level of access a service has.


## Headless Services
- Services without a ClusterIP for direct Pod-to-Pod communication.


## Service Topology
- Allows routing of traffic based on Node labels.


## Dual-Stack Services
- Services can be IPv4/IPv6 dual-stack enabled for hybrid communication.


## Quality of Service (QoS)
- Services don't have QoS guarantees but the Pods backing them can have QoS classes like `Guaranteed`, `Burstable`, and `BestEffort`.


## Service Mesh
- Istio or Linkerd can be used for advanced service-to-service communication features like canary deployments, circuit breakers, etc.
