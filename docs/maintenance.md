# Kubernetes Maintenance

Regular maintenance is essential for ensuring the stability and performance of your Kubernetes clusters. This section covers key maintenance activities, including upgrading clusters, nodes, Kubernetes versions, and operating systems.

## Upgrading Kubernetes Clusters

<h3>Cluster Upgrades</h3>

Upgrading your Kubernetes cluster ensures you have the latest features, security patches, and performance improvements.

1. **Plan the Upgrade**
    - Review [release notes](https://kubernetes.io/releases/){:target="_blank"} and determine upgrade path.
    - Backup critical data and verify integrity.
    - Test the upgrade process in a staging environment.

2. **Perform the Upgrade**
    - Follow your Kubernetes distribution's upgrade documentation.
    - Monitor the upgrade process and be ready to roll back if needed.

<h3>Node Upgrades</h3>

1. **Prepare Nodes**
    - [Drain nodes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/safely-drain-node/){:target="_blank"} using `kubectl drain <node-name>`.
    - Upgrade Kubernetes components and OS packages.

2. **Rejoin Cluster**
    - Use `kubectl uncordon <node-name>` to bring nodes back online.

## Upgrading Kubernetes Versions

1. **Check Compatibility**
    - Review the [version skew policy](https://kubernetes.io/releases/version-skew-policy/){:target="_blank"} to ensure compatibility across your environment.
    - Review deprecated features and update manifests.
    - Test applications in a staging environment.

2. **Upgrade Control Plane and Nodes**
    - Follow [official Kubernetes documentation]((https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/cluster-upgrade/){:target="_blank"}) for upgrading components.
    - Upgrade `kubelet` and `kubectl` on nodes.

## Best Practices

- Regularly audit cluster configurations and security settings.
- Document maintenance activities and changes.
- Implement automated backup solutions to protect critical data.
